### Can I add a new password to a PDF that already has a password?
No. For security reasons, our application does not support adding a new password to PDF files that are already password-protected. You need to remove the existing password first, then add a new password.

### What if I forget the password I set?
Please be sure to remember the password you set, as PDF passwords are securely encrypted, and if you forget your password, you will not be able to recover the file contents. We recommend using a password manager or storing your password in a secure location.

## Remove Password Function

### How do I remove password protection from a PDF?
1. Select the "Remove Password" function from the main interface
2. Click the "Select" button to choose the password-protected PDF file
3. Enter the current password of the file in the password input field
4. Click the "Remove Password" button to start processing
5. After processing is complete, you can preview and export the PDF without password protection in the results page

### Can I remove a PDF's password protection without knowing the password?
No. Removing a PDF password requires knowing the original password. Our application does not support cracking PDF passwords, which is to protect the rights of document creators and document security.

### What happens if I enter an incorrect password?
If you enter an incorrect password, the application will display an "Incorrect Password" error message, and you will need to enter the correct password to continue the operation.

## File Processing and Export

### Where are the converted files stored?
Converted files are temporarily stored within the application. After completing the conversion, you can export the files to other locations on your device or share them with other applications through the results page.

### How do I export converted files?
On the results page, you can:
1. Click the "Export" button
2. Choose "Save to Photos" (for image files) or "Save to File"
3. Select the save location according to system prompts

### Does the app support batch processing of files?
Currently, our application supports converting multiple images to PDF (merged or separate), but other functions require processing each file individually. We are considering adding batch processing functionality in future versions.

### Is there a file size limit?
Although our application can process PDF files of most common sizes, processing extremely large files may cause performance degradation or insufficient device memory. For very large files, we recommend using professional PDF software on a desktop computer.
